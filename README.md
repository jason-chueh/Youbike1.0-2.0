# Youbike1.0-2.0
### A tool that combines the functionality of the YouBike 1.0 and 2.0 bike-sharing systems with Google Maps to help plan routes.

For students, YouBike is a good tool for daily commuting and rushing between classes. In the context of daily commuting, if one misses a bus or train, walking to the nearest station may result in the possibility of the station having no available bikes, or there may not be any parking spaces available at the destination, resulting in more variables that can be difficult to control. In the context of rushing between classes, YouBike 2.0 is distributed densely on campus and is a good helper for getting to class on time, but there is also the possibility of there being no bikes available at the starting point or no parking spaces available at the destination.
In response to the aforementioned usage scenarios, there are now apps available that have developed relevant functions. Below, we will compare the shortcomings of each app and provide solutions in our YouBike 1.5, which we have recently launched.
<ol><li>The official apps of youbike1.0 and youbike2.0:<br>
The two apps are actually quite similar in terms of functionality. The official app provides a map with all the 1.0 (2.0) stations marked on it, and users can manually click on the stations to view the remaining bikes and parking spaces. As for route planning, the app only provides a pink line on the map from the user's current location to the selected station.
However, we have found three shortcomings in its use:</li><br>

  1. Does not plan the entire route:<br>Users have to first decide which station to go to for borrowing or returning the bike. The route planning is also quite basic, as it can only guide the user from their current location to a station. In my personal experience, if I want to ride a 1.0 YouBike from Gongguan to the Technology Building, I have to navigate three times: from the MRT station to the 1.0 station, from one 1.0 station to another near the destination, and from the destination 1.0 station back to the MRT station. Using this app requires redoing the route planning three times, which is very troublesome.<br>
  2. Does not compute the commuting time:<br>The YouBike 1.0 app does not provide any time information. The YouBike 2.0 app, on the other hand, integrates the navigation function of Google Maps and displays the riding time. However, due to the aforementioned first drawback, the routes are very scattered, and users must run multiple segments and add up the time to get the commuting time, which is very inconvenient to use.
  3. The youbike1.0 app is independent with youbike2.0 app:<br>The 1.0 app only provides information about 1.0 stations and completely lacks information about 2.0 stations. Similarly, the 2.0 app does not provide any information about 1.0 stations. For example, if a student needs to ride from Guting (where only 1.0 stations are available) to the main library (where only 2.0 stations are available), they would need to open both apps and slowly compare and plan their route.
<li>Google map:<br> Google Maps also integrates shared bicycles, but currently there are only a few 2.0 stations (about seven to eight stations) on Google Maps. Although there are enough 1.0 stations, the updates on remaining bicycles and parking spaces are delayed and often differ greatly from the numbers published on the Youbike official website.</li></ol><br>
To address the pain points of students and make commuting time more accurate and controllable, as well as to fill in the gaps of the existing Youbike apps, we hope to develop a program that integrates Youbike 1.0 and 2.0 for commuting planning. With this program, users only need to enter their starting point and destination, and it will help them select a departure station with available bikes and a destination station with available parking spots, as well as the shortest complete path for commuting, taking into account possible transfers. Finally, the program will output two routes on the interface, showing the required time, remaining bikes, remaining parking spots, and textual navigation for the route.<br>
